# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview of Project
Crowdfunding data analysis was performed to assist the client in making an informed decision about the fundraising and pending launch of her new production. Line charts are provided to illustrate the relationships between successful/failed campaigns and their launch dates and what effect the funding goal had on the outcome of a campaign.

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The most successful launches occurred in the late Spring, especially in May (see chart: “Outcomes Based on Launch Date”). From there, the success rate trended steadily downward until another small uptick in the Fall. During this period, failed productions were modest with the largest gap between success and failure occurring in May. Although there were a smaller number of successful launches in April, there were also a reduced number of failed launches. The gap between success and failure was quite like that of May. Based on this result I would recommend a production launch in either April or May. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals
The highest success rate occurred between a goal of $30,000 and $34,999 (100%), while the lowest success rate occurred with a goal of $$45,000 and $49,999 (0%). It should be noted that even though the $30,000 and $34,999 goal range sported a 100% success rate there were only three outcomes that fell in that range. The client’s goal is around $10,000 and there is a reasonable sample size to analyze and draw a conclusion from in this funding range ($10,000 to $14,999).  

### Challenges 
If perhaps there was a more even distribution of funding goals, it would have been interesting to see how the higher funding goals compare to those on the lower end of the scale. In this sample there were 848 fundraising goals below $10,000, while only 194 had a fundraising goal equal to or above $10,000. The client’s goal was just over $10,000. While it makes sense to show the outcomes in percentages of the samples, it overlooks how few samples there were for higher fundraising goals, such as only 25 combined goals between $25,000 - $49,999. The chart “Number of Outcomes vs Goal” shows the number of fundraisers within each goal range. 

## Results
After analyzing the data, it appears a launch date in April/May and a fundraising goal between $5,000 and $25,000 would be preferable. As mentioned previously, the client’s fundraising goal is approximately $10,000. There appears to be little change in success rate for productions that fund-raised in the range lying directly below her goal ($5,000 - $9,999) and above her goal ($15,000 - $19,999). Thus, I feel her fundraising goal is sound. That said, I would advise a launch date in the mid to late Spring, based on the findings above.
